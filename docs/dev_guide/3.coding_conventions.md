# Coding Conventions

The core code of KCL is fully built by Rust, so we recommend that you follow the [Rust standard coding style](https://github.com/rust-lang/style-team). Thanks to Rust's rich and powerful language toolchains, we recommend that you use tools such as `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo fix` to check or refactor every commit of code change before submission.

## Line Length

Lines should be at most 100 characters. It's even better if you can keep things to 80.

## Tabs v.s. Spaces

Prefer 4-space indent.
